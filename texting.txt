Testing for Project 100: Picture suite

Note 1:
In main procedure user specifies picture to be modified. This program is
not set up to take pictures using the scribbler robot, but this could 
be achieved by:
1) adding rConnect(/dev/rfcomm0); to the first line of the main program 
2) addind rDisconnect(); to the line just before the return statement of
main and
3)replacing the line 
 Picture * loadPic = rLoadPicture
    ("/home/jervisre/csc161/projects/project_100/flowers.jpg"); 

in main with the line 
Picture * loadPic = rTakePicture();

Note 2: 
in the documentation for the MyroC header file, the function 
rGetPictureHeight() is said to retrieve the height of a picture and 
rGetPictureWidth() is said to retrieve the width. Upon testing, however,
it appear that these values are often switched. Throughout this program
the variables height and width are declared as follows:
  width =rGetPictureHeight(pic);
  height =rGetPictureWidth(pic);
To correct for this error without generating confusion. If for some reason 
when testing the program does not compile and returns an out of bounds
error, these two values can be switched and the problem will be rectified.
